As part of the 2020 Cambridge ALTA hackathon, I worked in a team of 2 to develop an Alexa Skill target at beginner English language learners to help them improve their grammar in their english. All code was written by me and can be found [here][github-link].

Below you can find the video that I recorded for ALTA to distribute internally within their organisation which explains how the skill works and includes a demo. Many thanks to my team mate Andrew who came up with the original idea and provided me content for the prompts. 

As we use the [Write and Improve API][write-improve] we were unable to publish the app before the end of the hackathon and thus unfortunately not able to demo it on an Alexa device. However, ALTA has said they will look into this and may provide us with authorisation in the coming months.
